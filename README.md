# High Performance Counters

We study how to design counters that can reach the highest possible clock frequencies.


## HPSlow

This is our proposed design currently described in the paper below.

It is composed of a slow counter for the higher bits and a fast counter for the lower bits.

Test the slow counter in this [Colab Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidcastells/HPCounters/blob/main/test/jupyter/SlowCounter.ipynb)
